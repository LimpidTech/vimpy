Vimpy
=====

Simply put, Vimpy allows you to write Vim plugins without writing any
Vimscript. This is done by abstracting Vim commands through a Pythonic
interface.

**NOTE:** This is pre-alpha softare. As much as it should work as documented, there
is potential for issues to arrise. If they do, please [create an issue][issue]
so that we can make this software better. We welcome any feedback, suggestions,
or complaints. Please don't be shy!

Documentation
-------------

[Vimpy's documentation][wiki] is available at the [GitHub wiki page][wiki]. If
you run into any problems with the documentation, or if you just have a
recommendation on how to make it better - please don't hesitate to [create a
new issue][issue]. We expect that Vimpy might have a couple issues, and will
always want to make this library better in any way possible.
