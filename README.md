Vimpy
=====

Imagine you had a Vim module. Imagine Vimscript was a horrible excuse for a
programming language... Actually, just imagine that first one.

This project lets you use Python to script vim without any Vimscript. Seriously.

If your module is called *Cheese* and you put a Python package inside
of it called cheese, then Vimpy will do the hard work for you - and
automatically import your cheesy package.

Just import vim in one of your modules, and you're ready to go.

This README will get better when I have time to work on it.
